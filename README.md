# Sorting Visualizer

This is a project that visualizes the sorting of a given array with multiple algorithm options. 
I started this project because I was always fascinated that the concept of organization could be so easily captured within algorithms, as well as the fact that some core mathematical principles can make some incredibly-fast algorithms. 

I wrote this project in Plain HTML and Javascript, using the canvas element as the workhorse for drawing / animation. Overall a super fun project and I'm glad I got to learn more about JS through the whole thing.

Update fall 2022
I'm taking algorithms analysis again, and while it's been a (wonderful) year since I've written JS for any project, I've been feeling the urge to make stuff again so I figured this would be a good place to start
